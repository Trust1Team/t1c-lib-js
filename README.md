# Trust1Connector JavaScript Library
[![][t1c-logo]][Trust1Connector-url]

The Trust1Connector library (T1C-Lib), is a javascript library to communicate with the Trust1Connector. The library simplifies the execution to the connector and works asynchronously.

This is version 2 of the library, and is intended to be used with Trust1Connector v2+.

When the Trust1Connector isn’t installed the library will return an uninitialised client which can be used to download a client installer.

## Backward compatibility
The library will detect the installed version of Trust1Connector and will only function with version 2.0.0 and higher.

If you have version 1.x.x installed you have two options:

  * Upgrade to version 2+ (recommended)
  * Use an older version of the library by running:

```bash
$ npm i trust1connector@1.8.3
```
(currently v1.8.3 is the latest version compatible with T1C v1)
