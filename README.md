## Trust1Connector *v2*

The Trust1Connector library (T1C-Lib), is a javascript library to communicate with the Trust1Connector. The library simplifies the execution to the connector and works asynchronously.

This is version 2 of the library, and is intended to be used with Trust1Connector v2+.

When the Trust1Connector isnâ€™t installed the library will return an uninitialised client which can be used to download a client installer.

```bash
$ npm i trust1connector@2.4.3
```
(currently v2.4.3 is the latest version compatible with T1C v2)
